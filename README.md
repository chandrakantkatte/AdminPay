Employee Management: Create and manage employee records.
Vendor Management: Create and manage vendor records.
Email Notifications: Send notifications to vendors and keep track of email records.
In-Memory Data Storage: Utilizes an in-memory repository for development purposes, ensuring fast data access and manipulation.
Front-End Application: Built with React, this component provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the back-end services. It includes:

Employee Form: Allows users to input and submit employee details.
Vendor Form: Provides a form to add and manage vendor information with validation.
Data Tables: Displays lists of employees and vendors, with real-time updates and status indicators.
